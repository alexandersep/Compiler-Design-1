My solutions to 3rd year assignments (2023) for Compiler Design I.

## Flex script
I created a script when first writing flex code, this code is intended for the purposes of folders
which have only .l files. In future I began using Makefiles

* How to run:
    1. Enter a directory such as `plates` and run the command: `.././flex-run-script.sh plates.l < tests.txt`
